# EZ-autoRental-Company-Project 
# Project ojectives:
 EZRental Inc., has hired NYC-Tech Solutions Inc., to design & implement suite of Auto Rental Point-of-Sales
Management System Applications that include EZRental POS intended for Customer Service Representative and other
employees in the rental agencies, in addition to an INTRANET Corporate Website named EZRentalCorp.com intended
for business employees in the corporate offices, and finally, an e-commerce Internet Website name EZRental.com
intended for customers via the internet to make and manage reservations.
# NYC Tech Solutions INC:
NYC Tech Solutions Inc was represented by Professor Rodriguez who hired me as a consultant application and Database developer to implemenet and code the application.

# Solution:
EZ Auto Rental system was outdated. Therefore, two of the major Project Management Methodologies were used: The WATERFALL methodology & the AGILE 
methodology. 
The project was split and completed into four major phases:
# Phase1:
a project plan was discussed and documented that later was sent to EZ AUTORENTAL.
# Phase2 
an EER diagram was design that later became relational schema. Then datatype was decided for each table in the 
relational schema.
# phase 3 
ORACLE SQL developer was used to create the tables and populate them according to the data dictionary.
#  phase 4 
NYC-TECH SOLUTIONS test the database inserting data into the tables. The way we made 
sure the database was working perfectly was by performing INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE AND DELETE statements.
